1,1,"Non-verbal cues are the basis of partner dancing, that being said, I feel the need to very attentive to my partners non-verbal cues. Once I am mindful of his physical intention, intensity, movement, direction, I feel grounded, at peace and secure in my own movement."
1,2,"Being connected with my breathing, check my level of anxiety, if it is high, deep breaths in and out, breathing from the belly to reduce levels of anxiety and feel more grounded, present and able to receive and give out timely and non-contradictory sensory cues."
1,3,"The psychogical aspects are at the top of my list. Basic notions such as interpersonal communication, anger control, being aware of one's own anxiety levels and behaviour before, during and after practive, shows, events or competitions. Basic compassion, having a third party resolve issues not being resolved within the partnership, i.e. a counsellor, a sport psychologist or a mentor. Temperaments and personality that fit, get a long are as important as an ideal physical match."
1,4,"Connection with the breath, hearing the heartbeat of your partner, breathing a couple of breaths in synch before the inition of dance steps are keys to dancing in tandem in Argentine tango."
1,5,"Yes, breath and rhythm are central in partnering since it is a great way to be mindful of the other person state of mind and state of body at the initiation of a dance contact."
1,6,"Yes, touch is important since it is a powerful tool in stimulating our sensory system. Furthermore, while we are dancing and contact is achieved, our sensory motor system makes new neuronal pathways that transfer novel movements placed in our short-term memory into a more definite long-term memory. Once in our long-term memory, our brain can repeat a sequence of movements with less mental effort and concentration, this is the basis of learning."
1,7,"I take or give weight, by transfering weight from one foot to another while staying in axis. I breathe out and come forward laterally to give weight through my chest, and release the weight by moving back laterally my foot first and my chest follows."
1,8,"Since verbal cues are not used, visual contact remains a powerful tool is activating our sensory motor system. Visual cues are quick to pick up and react to."
1,9,"The common centre is the pillar of our common movement. Both partners need to give and take from the common centre, if one take's too much energy, the other person's movement will be weak, and vice versa, if too much force is given, the other will be overpowered."
1,10,"Breathing into each other's chest, mindful meditation, listening to eachother's heartbeat."
2,1,"40's female, professional, contemporary ballet and ballroom. The synchronicity is the joy. As a woman in ballroom there is a mystery when you are being lead in unchoreographed material that is a test of your zen-like ability to be in the moment. When timing is jsut right in choreographed work, it simply magnifies the experience of dancing alone."
2,2,No tricks... Breath is important.
2,3,"Clarity, breath, patience, trust, confidence in both yourself and your partner, imagination/visualization of the material (especially in big lifts), timing, eye contact, clear leg work and weight."
2,4,"Not sure how to answer this question. Generally partner work in any form shares elements. Above I pointed out a difference in ballroom (when unchoreographed/improvised). SO I guess I have already identified a difference, but it is not so great a difference in terms of the act of partnering, just how it evolves. Physical and visual contact are 2 of many approaches."
2,5,"Yes. as above. Without rhythm it is nearly impossible. Breath is the glue that identifies ""where"" the dancers are going next. Similarly, rhythm is a kind of breath pulse. Equally necessary."
2,6,"Yes. One needs to know how to touch a partner, hand grips and points of contact that are the communication of readiness."
2,7,Sometimes it is merely a matter of retaining your own line and letting your partner manipulate it. Others is can be about finding the vector force that matches the pull from the partner. Part of this is about visualization of the of the movement.
2,8,It can be the whole thing or it can be very little. Depends on the kind of work.
2,9,"I don't use this phrase, maybe I'd say shared centre, but I suppose this is the point where forces meet if separate, or the plumb line point in stacking."
2,10,"Simple leans and shared weight through various contacts starting with hands. But most important, work on material!"
3,1,I am a male Professional Ballroom dancer - when i dance with a partner i feel that i am sharing my upper body which makes two people move simultaneously however allowing me to' still have freedom of my own body - ideally for two people to' move in harmony with quality dancing both individuals must have a great dept of understanding of technique of how to' move our body weight from one leg to' another ( mechanics of joints ) in relation to' the frame which Are joined together. Therefore understanding how to' use the frame when moving with a partner is essential for quality of movement.
3,2,Of Course a good frame is definately created from when two body weights Are moving towards each other or away from each other which makes resistance in the arm joints logical and natural - allowing the dancers to' use this resistance only when necessari. Also to' build partnering skills - standing one in front of the other no hold and trying to' mirror one anothers movements at different speeds and movements through all the limbs and joints not only actual steps. In conclusion this is what partnerships do - mirror each other between resistances (which is lead and follow)
3,3,"In partner work there is leader and a follower - however leader only means ""CUE"" therefore the follower should wait for the CUE and be' ready to' react a split second later. Going back to' what i wrote in question 2 - ""resistance and mirroring"" - understanding how to' use your joints in relation to' Where your body weight is with your partners and then being able to' react when a ""CUE"" is given."
3,4,Like i mentioned previously it is essential to' build physical contact (resistance) and visual contact (visual) which make partnership dancing possibile - therefore other stlyles of dance definately contribute
3,5,Definately! Ideally for a partnership to' be' a perfect team not only must they have knowledge of what they Are doing and rhythm but there level of skill and ability must be' of the same caliber to' ultimately acheive a perfect partnership.
3,6,"Definately! Like i explained previously ""CUE and resistance"". I would say there Are different Tones of touch which Are related to' music (speed, melody, expression ) which make ""CUE & resistance"" happen therefore different Tones in touch whether through body weight or simply touching a hand or arm will make the bodies move at the same time or just feel and express that particular moment at the same time to' finally create a "" moment "" or story or situation. Basically touch is very important but reacting to that ""touch"" brings me to what I said previously - knowledge of mechanics and how to use it in relation to your partners ""touch"" which will make ""resistance"" necessary when to resist a push or a pull when ""cue"" is given and how s long this resistance lasts that is directly related to breathing for we breath to rhythm or music which results in ""movement & expression"" through ones personal interpretation."
3,7,"Weight in partnership dancing is given to receive or held back to receive. Therefore the person who gives the ""cue"" will a split second before give more body Weight towards the partner should he want his partners weight to delay and delay his body away from his partner to bring his partners weight back to him - these actions are directly related to ""cue & resistance"" and must say that weight is not only ones own balance but a partnerships balance"
3,8,"When we use visual lead through mirroring exercises we develop spontanuaty which is very important for simultaneous movements which are again directly related to ""cue & resistance"" through visual contact - knowledge of how to move your body and maintaining contact with your partner just a if he were touching you but visually."
3,9,"For me the word ""Simatry"" is similar to a common center. Maintain a certain space for each partner to dance on and where the edges of these spaces meet are your common center - I often say each person in standing in a whooloo hoop and where they touch is the common center ""resistance""."
3,10,Leaning towards and away from each other at different speeds and holds through arms and hands for different ways touching each other will directly affect contact.
4,1,"Responsibility to support them and enhance the movements, (stuart, ex ballet pro dancer, 52)"
4,2,Practise and intuition
4,3,Know how your partner moves
4,4,"Most dance is enhanced by partner work, it adds a dimention of passion to the Latin American Tango, to tap and jazz it adds an element of excitement, in Ballet and modern dance it can add an extension to the movements, and an element of risk."
4,5,"Breath and rythm are important as they allow the movements to flow in a uniform manor, with a togetherness."
4,6,"You must have a feel for your partner, this is enhanced with physical contact"
4,7,When supporting you must take the weight of your partner when lifting of taking a pose which involves you partner being unable to have there weight on the floor in a balanced position.
4,8,The visual contact gives a conection seen by an audiance
4,9,"Common center would be the centre of balance mutual to both using movements whilst connected with either hands or in a lift/pose, that can take them slightly off the central point, either both in the same direction, of moving apart."
4,10,"Mentaly going through the movements, thinking about the off balance points in the movements"
5,1,"a) aged 48, male, professional level ,contemporary and contact improv b) When I dance with a partner I feel supported; in communication; there is added strength and sensitivity; a shared experience; committment; a dialogue"
5,2,"I am a direct or as gentle as the choreography demands; I try to find a shared rhythm and breath in order to help timing; I have to be aware of making my body's support mechanisms available - such as my 'shelves and levers' = pelvis, shoulders, thighs, neck, back, feet and chest; I have to be clear in the way I use my hands to 'grip and slip'; I have to trust my partner's trust in my/us"
5,3,"Trust, committment, a willingness and ability to lead and be lead, clarity of direction, safety and risk, spatial awareness, ease of touch, yield and push, fall and support"
5,4,I think there are similarities; I enjoy the seeming ease and trust of the physical contact in most styles; I enjoy the way visual contact is used to suggest emotional qualities of relationship as well as a 'dual' effort and endeavour; I enjoy it when people really do SEE each other and take account of a shared space and experience; I like the elegance and coyness of ballroom dancing visual contact when sometimes the dancers look directly at each other and sometimes don't or they half-look; in ballet it seems odd that often the man's focus is on the woman but the woman's is out/somewhere else in space or to the audience
5,5,"yes both are incredibly important as they give ease to the movement and freedom in the body to support or be supported, they connect the duo in timing terms to a better degree, it helps communication between the two bodies in hwlping to move on or hold/suspend"
5,6,"without it certain movement would be impossible, it connects two or more people together to offer possibilities for impulse and initiation, re-direction in space, momentum"
5,7,"in contact improv work I try to be prepared for any possibility and make offers to lift/support or be lifted/supported; I try to be clear in how much weight I'm giving and be sensitive to when that could/should change; I make certain surfaces available for sliding, gathering, propping, balancing"
5,8,it can be overused and it can be absent it is possible for people to partner each other and be blind - literally and metaphorically speaking - partnering can be managed using other senses = touch and hearing it can be essential that partners see each other in order to 'use' each other
5,9,"the point from which two people are negotiating a shift of weight, support/balance; the point of a connection of strength and flexibility; the point at which two bodies can 'guess' where to go next and for how long"
5,10,warming up into it; checking in by starting 'lightly'/gently
6,1,"37, elite performer 17 years - Contemporary"
6,2,"Good co-ordination,"
6,3,"Good relationship with partner, trust"
6,4,I think the essence is the same across genres
6,5,"Extremely, they're the foundations of co-ordination and connection between dancers"
6,6,"Yes, an awareness and sensitivity of body contact or touch allows non verbal information to be passed between partners"
6,7,With sensitivity and awareness
6,8,It is important but it depends on the choreography
6,9,Understanding where you're combined centre of gravity is
6,10,Trust exercises? Partners change every performance so important to rehearse prior to each performance with a change? But connection re-established quickly.
7,1,blending of two bodies into one
7,2,improv training
7,3,"communication and understanding, equal or similar ability"
7,4,"Interesting but with different intentions for each, hence different technique"
7,5,"definitely, when coordinated they allow for better communication through the body"
7,6,"Yes, touch done correctly can be very beneficial to partnering."
7,7,I practice transfering weight and try to coordinate catching and falling with my partner
7,8,"quite, it is what keeps us balanced and connected in timing most of the time"
7,9,"That is where the two partners meet and blend into one another, a neutral zone"
7,10,"yes, balancing, stretching in and out, improv."
8,1,"Different moments, different feelings: sometimes uncertainty, sometimes the need to be good enough in the partner's eyes. but it is also a pleasure to create movement together, if things run smoothly and fit perfectly the music. in that case it is even more enjoyable than dancing alone."
8,2,"A partner-warming up helps a lot. Start with touching (e.g. hands) and make simple movements together, kind of calibrating two different bodies and ways to move."
8,3,#NAME?
8,4,"Depends, on what one wants to express with a certain dance. if it is about two persons relating to each in whatever way, than contact (visual/physical) is indispensable."
8,5,"Yes, I think they are. It refers to my point in question 2. Different bodies have different sizes/lengths, steps, depths, produces different shapes during movement. Synchronizing through rhythm may be not only important, but necessary."
8,6,"Touch is a good way to experience new ways to move. Everybody dances very different from oneself. Through a connection in touch, it is the only way to feel the rhythm, flow, shapes of someone else, which might reveal completely new ways or ideas to move."
8,7,"Usually with hips, elbows, wrists. The position of the centre of gravity is generally important. Sometimes by leaning the whole body against the other person."
8,8,"Depends on the message of the dance. But usually there is a reason why 2 people dance together- to relate to each other in a certain way, which makes visual contact crucial. Also, through visual contact, energy can be exchanged through the room/stage, which the audience usually feels and enjoys the performance more."
8,9,"My first association is a common physical property, a common centre of gravity or angular momentum or similar."
8,10,"going for a happy drink from times to times. dance-wise: to feel the other body move during predictable (basic steps) or unpredictable (improvisation) is usually a good improvement of contact. This altogether improves the predictability of the other person dancing, which makes it easier to adapt/assimilate to that."
9,1,"Exposed, engaged, more concentrated, connected."
9,2,"Talking smoother, smiling more, exchange feedback in order to be closer, exploration of touch, understanding who the other person is."
9,3,"Dialogue, repetition, trust, chemistry."
9,4,"I find it very interesting and it is usually creating a more interesting atmosphere, helps you get out of your own self. Exploration."
9,5,"Of course, because of connectivity. To have the feeling that the two bodies become one."
9,6,Positively.
9,7,"Release and support, lead and follow, breath."
9,8,Very much but maybe touch is actually more important.
9,9,"Every movement is being initiated from each dancers body center , but happening simultaneously with similar effort."
9,10,"Yes. Falling and catching to improve trust, massage to get used to the touch, copying one another in movement to improve awareness."
10,1,depends on the partner;)
10,2,every trick takes years of practice and only works with dancers who have discovered the same trick
10,3,looking up to your partner for some reason
10,4,depends on the piece I usually like to see the movement explored to the extreme
10,5,the movement is much more credible when practiced enough until becomes natural and merges with own and partners breathing
10,6,naturally
10,7,depends on the story. gradually usually works better
10,8,it has its moments
10,9,we called it shared axis it is a nice moment that only works when the body weight of both dancers is distributed evenly around the axis
10,10,contact improvisation offers a lot of different possibilities to explore contact
11,1,Chemistry or no chemistry.
11,2,"Holding your core. Use of plie and ""listening"" to your partner."
11,3,Chemistry
11,4,It depends on the context
11,5,"Sure. If this is required if you are using counts, the you need to use rhythm."
11,6,Yeah
11,7,Holding your core and releaxing.
11,8,It really depends on the work.
11,9,No Response
11,10,maybe contact improv.
12,1,Less thinking an more just going with the flow.
12,2,Yielding into each other and ground. Listening to body language both the other person and yourself.
12,3,No hesitations. Believing in what is going on at that moment.
12,4,"Positive. The more i get to know about my dance mates way of thinking when dancing, I develop my ways of dancing."
12,5,"Yes, definitely. Breath for me is rhythm. If my partner is in another breath he or she will have another rhythm and we will not work well together. Our thought run faster or slower depending on the breath and pulse. Just what i think."
12,6,Yes and no. Sometimes just the share of energy of the other person feels like partnering.
12,7,"yielding. listening, bodylanguage. sometimes eyes closed help to feel the other persons energy."
12,8,i think it is important. I think that dance is visual and tha is what dance is at the end of the day. Visual.
12,9,sharing the point of centre in contact.that is where the bodies have their meeting point.
12,10,Yes.
13,1,"Depends on the choreography, the partner, the connection, the context. What is asked for in that particular moment."
13,2,Just technical ones.
13,3,To be able to communicate on all levels with your partner to have a functional relationship. To feel and breath with eachother and in the same rythm.
13,4,I like it.
13,5,"Yes, it is essential to make it work with the partner to make a functional relationship."
13,6,"Depends on. Amazing partner work can happen without touch as well. If there is a duet in physical terms, of course touch is essential. Depends on the nature of choreography and whatr is required"
13,7,Depends on the situation.
13,8,Not too much. A kinesthetic and kinespheric sense is far more important.
13,9,That the partners work within the same centre to function as one.
13,10,Could be. Depends on the partner.
14,1,"I usually dance the parts which are alone better..about what i feel, nothing special to my partner.i just feel the music and think of the partner as a ""tool"" on which i have to show my feelings."
14,2,hmm no not necessarly
14,3,give and take ( push-pull) and release. eye contact and the understanding of the couples needs.
14,4,physical and visual contact in all types of dances are crucial
14,5,ofcourse. breathing gives you speed. rhythm might be less important for the girl in latin becuase she usually follows.
14,6,ofcourse
14,7,throught the body centers meeting at the level of the hands.
14,8,very important
14,9,the middle point between the couples on the level of the belly.
14,10,ofcourse
15,1,"Connection, communication or lack of it. If it's a good connection I feel relaxed and at ease, enjoying the moment. If the connection is bad I feel unease and frustration"
15,2,"In terms of connection. The woman either understands how to connect properly or not. If she doesn't, I default to some basic merengue type push and pull to manipulate her into some semblance of dance and fun."
15,3,Connection. Body weight. Communication. Mutual willingness to make it work. Respect.
15,4,"Very important in all dances I do. I'm primarily ballroom, championship level (Canada) but also avid salsa and latin dancer at the clubs (6 days a week). I prefer light physical contact but find it hard to lead women if they're not engaged with me at every level. Especially in salsa where I may check a women so her back is to me, it's often easier to lead her in certain moves if she turns her head to make eye contact."
15,5,"Yes, like tai chi or martial arts or any other sport, breathing is paramount to achieve power and speed. One has to control breathing to match the cadence and musicality and requirements of the dance. For example in paso the explosive expulsion of breath on the apel, or in a progressive link in tango."
15,6,"Yes, but the more advanced then the less required. Eventually a connection can be so sincere that no touch is required to perform a lead and follow."
15,7,"Only when required. More the transfer or impulse than the transfer of weight. Sometimes I give more weight or impulse when required, for example to stimulate the lady into multiple turns, or into an untwist from a left whisk. I will give the initial power but then, if we're doing showdance, we may change the lead and she power me around in american style while I ronde. Give and take, where required."
15,8,"I feel it is very important. In ballroom there are moments of emotional interplay where a meeting of the eyes can convey emotion, for example in various picturelines."
15,9,The idea of a core from which the partners are connected. Depending on the figures the common center may change.
15,10,"When I demonstrate connection to people I do the practice hold and then get them to slightly resist, so we establish connection, then move them backwards and forwards and from side to side. As I trasfer my weight forward, if they are resisting, they will transfer their weight by stepping back and I find this is the simplest way to explain basic connection. Now when my partner and I practice we often use the music at 50% speed and work on the dynamics between the movements and this helps improve our connection"
16,1,Sharing the moment of emotion caused by the music and partnerring
16,2,"Try to call back the sensation feeled when a ""perfect"" moment was present, that sets you in the good mood."
16,3,Respect for each other
16,4,Really important! It can make the differance
16,5,Rhythm yes breath less
16,6,"Yes, otherwise you need strenght to transfer the signals instead of touch"
16,7,From the center
16,8,Not at all
16,9,The shared feeleing of body language
16,10,Swing from right to left with center contact only
17,1,power
17,2,first move into own space
17,3,listening to each other
17,4,which?
17,5,sure...u need to syncronize
17,6,yes
17,7,gently
17,8,on a scale of 1 to 10: 10
17,9,home of contact
17,10,"no, just practice a lot"
18,1,"Championship level Ballroom and Latin dancer, having danced 10 years. Currently ranked 27th in the world in Senior 1 Ten Dance. Male. Amateur but also teaching part time. Note that your survey doesn't provide a box for putting this information. I like the effect of moving as one. That is what I try to achieve. The closer it feels to dancing without a partner, the better it comes to what I think is the ""ideal"" of two people moving as one."
18,2,No Response
18,3,The man must know how to lead. Leading early enough and in the right way is everything. It is the essential component to being a strong partnership.
18,4,"Other styles generally just rely on visual leading, but mostly the choreography is based on queue points in the music, teaching everyone to move a certain way at the same time. Not as satisfying."
18,5,Partners must breathe properly. It helps the flow of the movement and ensures both are moving equally.
18,6,You cannot have strong partner work without touch.
18,7,Odd question. It is part of the technique.
18,8,"There are some aspects, some steps that require visual contact. It is all you have to lead. But visual connection between the partners is essential to tell the story of the dance, even if it is not used to facilitate the lead or movement itself. How you look at one another is a large part of the story."
18,9,"There is always a common center. It may be used as the point around which the partners rotate, or at which they move swing past each other, one making room for the other, then vice versa."
18,10,"Very slow movement in sync, usually forwards and backwards. Also touching palms together to develop lead/follow by maintaining equal pressure at all times while moving."
19,1,"Passion, connection, emotion,"
19,2,No just awareness of body and movement.
19,3,Non verbal conversation.
19,4,In any type of dance it is important to have both.
19,5,Yes because it is all part and parcel of the communication to one another and the music.
19,6,Imperative.
19,7,I create an awareness of opposition.
19,8,Very
19,9,"That you are both aware of the distance, space, and volume of the partnership."
19,10,Making sure that you and your partner are always on balance by not pushing or pulling.
20,1,"Depends on the partner, style of dance and difficulty, whether it is a new partner, woman or man, whether we are in rehearsal or in performance.   But in a performance where all is rehearsed I concentrate on dancing and expressing the meaning/feeling/expression of the choreography in unison with my partner."
20,2,"Relax, listen to body language."
20,3,Listen to each other and feel each other‚Äôs limits which will make us able to explore new material together
20,4,My style of dance is modern. Physical and visual contact in partnering is necessary in any style of dance.
20,5,"Yes, we have to be able to dance together. Without a common rhythm we won‚Äôt."
20,6,"Depends on choreography, but yes, when leaning, lifting, holding, and finding new ways to do so it is necessary to touch. But not all partnering work have to include touch, depends on what the choreographer wants"
20,7,"That depends on the choreography, expression or what you want to convey. Physically, both parts need to know how we relate to each other to be able to dance together.  "
20,8,"Again, it depends on the choreography, the visual contact need to relate to the kind of relationship we have or have to express. It is not always a romantic one in modern dance. We can communicate both visually and through our bodies, and if we know each other well we do not always have to look at each other to know where we are or what to do, we can feel it. "
20,9,"I have not heard that term before, but knowing where to be in relation to each other to create a common expression"
20,10,Rehearsal and contact improvisation will improve how we move  and relate to each other. 
20,11,"Your questions seem to be related to your ballroom style. In modern dance we use each other all the time, partnering often with more than one, men and women. We use each other by lifting, leaning, being under, over, dragging, falling, catching etc and need to relate to each other as partners, and often to more than one person at the same time. If I have a romantic partnering choreography I need to communicate that to the audience, but if I have a plain leaning and lifting task for the sake of movement I need to express just that.   My feeling towards the partner will change as I change partners all the time and have different moods or feelings I need to express depending on the choreography.  As for the relationship between me and my partner we need to be comfortable with each other to make it work and worth watching. "
21,1,"Depends on the relationship, if it‚Äôs a good one quite conformable, it depends on the chemistry, if there is mutual like it can feel nice."
21,2,Touch communication
21,3,"Chemistry, confidence"
21,4, Not sure what this question means
21,5,Its part of the movement in dance when solo so it will impact on partner work
21,6,Why else would you need a partner
21,7,Can discuss before hand or signal to your partner
21,8,You need to listen to and watch each other to sense the movements
21,9,A joining of your centres
21,10,"Contact improvisation, one leading one following with eyes closes"
22,1,"Excitement, nice to be able to trust and be trusted, inspire through movement and be inspired. A dialogue through movement. Shared time and space in order to move together in a certain, agreed way."
22,2,"Touch, gaze, controlling the weight and positions as precisely as possible."
22,3,"Trust, shared vocabulary and goals in movement, style and technique."
22,4,Both are powerful tools to create a strong and powerful connection between the movers. A connection also visible to the watcher.
22,5,"Both very important for timing and shared moments of effort for movement efficiency (like in turns, big traveling steps and lifts)"
22,6,"Yes, it creates connectivity between partners, shows trust and respect towards each other, can give movement that certain sth."
22,7,"Weight can be used apart from each other and supported by each other, together with a shared center, depends on the technique and the style of dance"
22,8,In looking at each other we agree to move together. Important also for cueing in big lifts e.g.
22,9,Two or more bodies can share the same center in order to create movement. It is the center of that certain movement and not of gravity
22,10,"Sharing experiences of movement and moving together in conversations, trying moves in different ways to find the one ‚Äúthat works for us‚Äù. Having an outside eye to see ‚Äúif what we feel and what we are trying to show‚Äù can be seen. Practice alone AND together or change positions (the one that carried, will be carried e.g.)."
22,11,"The conenection between partners is essential as it can blow of everything a dancer has learned. If the connection is not there, none of the two can perform at his/her  highest ability. Concentrating on what I do or the partner does differently in repetitions can bring valuable results when used as new input. The touch we use in dance should be suitable for what it is used for or what it should represent."
23,1,
23,2,"Personally, I find they need to be slowly ëunpackedí, people must first release tension and then try to be dynamic, body time is needed for this processÖa communication must happen between the students and the teacher. The students must be able to retain the information and reproduce it when the teacher is not there. It is more than just learning how to be a ëgood tableí. Also, to be able to improvise requires an understanding of certain body awareness rather than only choreography. As the martial arts take stages of development, the same I use in contact, information consumption is not necessarily its embodiment."
23,3,
23,4,"As the origins of contact are from various disciplines; Steve Paxton was influenced by yoga, aikido, was a gymnast and a modern dancer, it is inherently related to them. Also on a political and social levels Contact was about democratizing dance and allowing for other sources to influences to come in such as those from various eastern practices and philosophies. The concepts of circularity, energy, dyads and social dance are all outcomes of that and are a part of contact.Learning how to use your weight, experiencing the center between two bodies would help understand the center in any form. In ballroom it can probably be used to help the couple work together through the center, even though there is a leader/follower element involved, it can benefit from lets say eyes closed training to improve the sensitive from both sides."
23,5,
23,6,"Waking up the body, being aware, applied to dance it can help recognize different aspects of contact (blue vs green vs red) sensitizing the body for contact. Sensing the difference between a light touch or giving weight, it seems obvious but is not always so, especially for beginners. Being able to recognize, to feel it in yourself and then play with it together with another body."
23,7,"A common misconception is about strength being needed while forgetting the natural utility of the body as a tool. We understand this generally as we pick up and carry things around but donít always know how to deal with this in terms of another body. It is not only about understanding the mechanics of the body but a social issue as well, to open all your skin surfaces to an unfamiliar body is a weird conceptÖwe need to let go of some things to do that but often we donít even know what it is it we need to let go offÖengaging with a pelvis is another principle that is common and even if understood can still be awkward for various reasonsÖ"
23,8,"In Contact Improv. eyes closed training often brings more sensitivity and helps reduce social anxiety related to touch etcÖAfter a time visual contact can be brought in to increase use of surrounding space, safety, and can be used as another method of communicating. (another open palette)"
23,9,
23,10,"Jamming in contact provides a community ground, a social context where people can communicate. The people who come there usually have some interest in opening themselves to new experiences and communicating. This is not about the exercise then but has a rippling effect where it promotes the same principles.Contact can also be taught with so many awareness exercises but more as a physical form, it depends on the teachers and simply has a different emphasis. One is not necessarily better than the other, just different paths. Perhaps one can lead to the other, inner awareness to physical manifestation and physical manifestation to inner awareness."
23,11,"In Contact Improv. there is a political element as well as it was never patented and meant to be shared by everyone, so everyone could use it in different ways to enhance their practices. Ballet on the other hand is different in form and politics so perhaps could not be used in the same wayÖ"
24,2,
24,3,some of the elastic stretching elements are used in contact to create more surfaces on the body for your partner while the spiraling helps create momentum and fit the bodies into each other during various sequences of movement (turning shoulder lift for example)
24,4,
24,5,Yes breath can be used to help timing and rhythm. You can try to practice the counterbalancing exercises using breath which should help the common rhythm and improve the sensitivity of the partnering balance. Also just proximity (e.g. hugging) can help partners get used to being and moving close and togetherÖ
24,6,
24,7,"In contact moves are developed by improvisation and exploration, teaching is one of the few impetuses for systematization. Use of weight and momentum are essential. For beginners the rolling and other floor exercises facilitate understanding of weight and movement. There are no really systematic steps to teaching and different teachers prioritize different elements."
24,8,
24,9,
24,11,"contact can help ballroom dancers be more economical and efficient in their movements perhaps as well as exploring more surfaces on the body, these principles can be adjusted from contact to the ballroom aesthetic to fit the form."
25,1,
25,2,
25,3,"Timing and music are also very important, without music, a natural rhythm that can develop between partners. All these elements are important for a good partnership"
25,4,"As far as other styles go, in contemporary there are a lot of elements that are similar to contemporary tango so as much attention is put into the awareness of touch, weight sharing, and visual contact as in tango. It is a question of stage or social context, ballet is mostly danced on stage with an outward focus while tango as a social dance is danced for yourself and that is an important differenceÖcompetitive ballroom and social ballroom also show a similar contrast. Since in tango both performance and social aspects exist people have a choice, if you want to dance socially and improvise it is one focus, while if you want to perform and work on choreography it is another. Everyone should find their own tangoÖ"
25,5,
25,6,Well touch is similar to weight sharing for me; the more experienced you are the more you can explore the possibilities and limits of weight sharing and touch
25,7,
25,8,"Visual contact is more about meaning, this brings me to another element that is spiritual, I canít dance with just anyone, there has to be a deeper connection and understanding"
25,9,
25,10,"Perhaps some games can be used to improve touch, weight sharing, and visual contact. Like some contact improvisation exercises, imagery, and rolling around the floor on top of each other are games for meÖ"
25,11,"I think one can get involved in other movement disciplines which can help in various ways, Tai chi for example can help with coordination and slowness in movement while contact improvisation can help explore different body surfaces. In tango there is only one main surface used (the embrace in the upper body, chest and sometimes head area depending on style) that is hard enough already to explore so discovering other surfaces can certainly be beneficial and might help the dancer be more aware of the sensations of touch etcÖ"
26,2,"It dependsÖwhen dancers already have a strong vocabulary they might not need to train specifically for partnering since they already ëspeak the same languageí. Otherwise the material might appear awkwardÖas is sometimes the case, so perhaps with lower level dancers those might be more importantÖWhen I met another experienced contact improviser it sometimes just clicks and things work naturally without specific trainingÖThe reason in contact we do these exercises is simply to get back to basics and keep training our awareness"
26,3,"There are political and social element always at play, what used to be is not the case now, dance expresses its timesÖalso touch today is usually considered sexual or violent and dance is one of the only places where people can communicate and connect physically without those social taboosÖit is also a community, just like the social ballroom instead of competitive, there are no winners or losersÖ"
26,4,"In ballet the choreography is for stage, the man is there to display the woman, in an old fashioned way. Now the world is different, a man might be supported by a woman and even a woman might be bigger than the manÖIt is political after all, contact was developed in a time of cultural change, feminism, and free love, and that is the values it reflectsÖIn a way the leading and following in ballroom is also a political statement."
26,5,
26,6,
26,7,
26,8,
26,9,
26,10,"Since contact is not driven by form but y the shape of the body and the its sensations certain aesthetical elements needed for ballroom are not necessarily present there, the question of aesthetics on top of that is an open one so with the leaning back and holding hands exercise for example in contact weíd let the back curve simply because it can do that and there is no need for us to stop it, it is aesthetic or rather natural for contact due to its philosophy and approach to the body. The improvisation aspect of Contact keeps it open and evolving but otherwise the ends of these exercises are similar in both styles. Even in contact a vocabulary eventually evolves even though it tries to break away from itÖ"
26,11,"Some dancers/choreographersí already combine ballet and contact, (Raphael Malison?) they learn the effects of gravity and weight on the body and interpret it through their knowledge. It is not really classical anymore, but rather a blend of ballet and martial arts and other influences."
27,2,"Sometimes personality comes into play in a partnership too, if a man is a narcissist he will never partner in same way as someone who is caring to his partner. The quality therefore is different in such a partnership because while most of the technical elements can be there, a lack of interest can affect the presence of certain performance qualities in a partnership."
27,3,"In classical ballet, it is common to use gestures to present the lady, inviting, calling or even rejecting in various forms. There is no improvisation so everything is choreographed and both dancers know what they need to do. Many theatrical elements come into play, the style of connecting might change from role to role (romantic, evil, pitiful, etcÖ) the posture and the style of movement might change with the character played (e.g. Spartacus vs Quasi modo)"
27,4,
27,5,
27,6,
27,7,
27,8,
27,9,
27,10,"Not really, we mostly practice partnering with choreography. A progressive approach from small jumps and supports to big lifts allows for improvement. In reality there is simply not much extra time in the 8 year curriculum to train extra element while there is so much work to be done to prepare the student for a professional career in ballet."
27,11,"It would be as useful as any other exercise to improve certain elements, it would of course be nice to be able to be work on these sensitivities but as they are not a priority for most ballet dancers, there is probably no time for them. On top of that using counterbalance often puts the dancer off the center line and that is a rare happening in classical ballet, in modern more perhaps but in classical such usage of connection would mainly be useful in waltzes and small jumps with a lift for the lady so perhaps it is simply a question of time and priorities."
